# Sum

Transforms for computing the sum of the elements in a collection, or the sum of the values associated with each key in a collection of key-value pairs.

### Sum of the elements in a PCollection

We use ```Combine.Globally()``` to get sum of all the element values from the entire ```PCollection```.

```
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  total = (
      pipeline
      | 'Create numbers' >> beam.Create([3, 4, 1, 2])
      | 'Sum values' >> beam.CombineGlobally(sum)
      | beam.Map(print))
```

Output

```
10
```

### Sum of the elements for each key

We use ```Combine.PerKey()``` to get the sum of all the element values for each unique key in a ```PCollection``` of key-values.

```
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  totals_per_key = (
      pipeline
      | 'Create produce' >> beam.Create([
          ('🥕', 3),
          ('🥕', 2),
          ('🍆', 1),
          ('🍅', 4),
          ('🍅', 5),
          ('🍅', 3),
      ])
      | 'Sum values per key' >> beam.CombinePerKey(sum)
      | beam.Map(print))
```

Output
```
('🥕', 5)
('🍆', 1)
('🍅', 12)
```
