# Mean

Transforms for computing the arithmetic mean of the elements in a collection, or the mean of the values associated with each key in a collection of key-value pairs.

### Mean of element in a PCollection

We use ```Mean.Globally()``` to get the average of the elements from the entire ```PCollection```.

```
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  mean_element = (
      pipeline
      | 'Create numbers' >> beam.Create([3, 4, 1, 2])
      | 'Get mean value' >> beam.combiners.Mean.Globally()
      | beam.Map(print))
```

Output

```
2.5
```

### Mean of elements for each key

We use ```Mean.PerKey()``` to get the average of the elements for each unique key in a ```PCollection``` of key-values.

```
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  elements_with_mean_value_per_key = (
      pipeline
      | 'Create produce' >> beam.Create([
          ('🥕', 3),
          ('🥕', 2),
          ('🍆', 1),
          ('🍅', 4),
          ('🍅', 5),
          ('🍅', 3),
      ])
      | 'Get mean value per key' >> beam.combiners.Mean.PerKey()
      | beam.Map(print))
```

Output

```
2.5
```

### Mean of elements for each key

We use ```Mean.PerKey()``` to get the average of the elements for each unique key in a ```PCollection``` of key-values.

```
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
  elements_with_mean_value_per_key = (
      pipeline
      | 'Create produce' >> beam.Create([
          ('🥕', 3),
          ('🥕', 2),
          ('🍆', 1),
          ('🍅', 4),
          ('🍅', 5),
          ('🍅', 3),
      ])
      | 'Get mean value per key' >> beam.combiners.Mean.PerKey()
      | beam.Map(print))
```

Output

```
('🥕', 2.5)
('🍆', 1.0)
('🍅', 4.0)
```
