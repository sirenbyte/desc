# Min

Provides a variety of different transforms for computing the minimum values in a collection, either globally or for each key.

```
import (
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam"
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/transforms/stats"
)

func ApplyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
	return stats.Min(s, input)
}
```

Calculate the minimum of the elements associated with each unique key.

```
import (
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam"
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/transforms/stats"
)

func ApplyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
	return stats.MinPerKey(s, input)
}
```
