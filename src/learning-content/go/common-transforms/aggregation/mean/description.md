# Mean

Transforms for computing the arithmetic mean of the elements in a collection, or the mean of the values associated with each key in a collection of key-value pairs.

```stats.Mean``` returns a transform that then returns a collection whose contents is the mean of the input collectionâ€™s elements. If there are no elements in the input collection, it returns 0.

```
import (
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam"
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/transforms/stats"
)

func ApplyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
	return stats.Mean(s, input)
}
```

Calculate the mean of the elements associated with each unique key.

```
import (
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam"
	"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/transforms/stats"
)

func ApplyTransform(s beam.Scope, input beam.PCollection) beam.PCollection {
	return stats.MeanPerKey(s, input)
}
```
